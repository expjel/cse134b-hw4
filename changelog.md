##### Changes to site:  
- Aligned demo video on Projects page
- Added padding to Projects page and Work & Experience page
- Fixed flexbox alignment issue on Work & Experience page to make formatting consistent
##### Third-party script: Google Analytics  
I made a Google Analytics account and then added the script to my homepage (index.html) because I think it would beinteresting to see the traffic on my portfolio and potentially where the traffic is coming from since I expect the audience of visitors to mostly be recruiters. I also think it would be helpful to have statistics on the device information of visitors so I can further optimize my site for the most frequent devices. The pages clicked from the homepage can also give me insight in which pages interest people the most and which ones may be repetitive or not enticing, so I can combine pages and furhter streamline the UX.
